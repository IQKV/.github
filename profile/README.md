## 📎Business Application Platform

IQKV Foundation is an open-source Java library designed for enterprise applications.

We provide a set of individual libraries for developing web services in Java, utilizing Spring Boot, Kafka, RabbitMQ, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
It is a true open-source project released under the Apache license and was initially derived from the JHipster framework.

Our motivation for developing the platform was to overhaul the fundamental design and transform the existing framework into a set of libraries tailored for Java developers.
We accomplish this by leveraging modern Java functionality, new technology, and modern tooling.

The project aims to provide a fast and structured way to kickstart the development journey. Reducing redundant coding time will allow you to set up new projects easily and efficiently.
Build internal tools, admin panels, dashboards & B2B apps with unmatched flexibility.

## 📐 App Scaffolding Templates

This is a curated, organized, and searchable catalog of ready-to-use Spring Boot app examples designed to help you kickstart your project.

Another approach is master programming by recreating popular web services utilizing the platform code, leveraging technology, business models, and industry best practices will accelerate growth.
